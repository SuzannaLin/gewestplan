# gewestplan
This repository contains a .qml for the Flemisch gewestplan.
Download the file and store at chosen location.
The lu_gwp_gv.qml file can be uplaoded in QGIS by openening the Layer Properties > bottom left drop down menu Style > Load style ... Select the .qml file.

The symbology is simplified. I did not include any letter descriptions on the layer colors. Feel free to add these and contribute to this repo.
